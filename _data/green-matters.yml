        <p>The Adansonia za is a genus of trees (za) found only in Madagascar, and, interestingly, are pollinated by moths. Large trees have been hollowed out by Malagasy villagers for water cistern. This genus was named by Linnaeus, after Michel Adanson, the French explorer-botanist who discovered it on the island of Sor, Senegal in 1749.</p>
        <p>This plant’s common name, Baobab, which you may find familiar, refers specifically to Adansonia digitata, and is often used to refer to genus in general. “Baobab” is derived from the Arabic word Buhibab, or “father of many seeds”. The Baobab’s large fruits can hold as much as 100 seeds!</p>
        <p>Adansonia za can be found at the drop-off point at the northern end of Bayfront Plaza car park.</p>
