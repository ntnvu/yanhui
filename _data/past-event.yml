  <p>At the Mid-Autumn Festival, members got to see the festival in a new light with our first-ever interactive lantern procession. The lanterns changed colours according to location, creating a magical shared experience.</p>
  <p>Members also got creative at our craft booths, trying their hands at a number of interesting activities like flower pressing, paper quilling and Chinese tea brewing, just to name a few.</p>
  <p>Spotted at the tea brewing booth was Family member Mrs Denise Lim, together with her husband and 2 children. “We really enjoyed viewing the giant lantern sets in the outdoor gardens, particularly the one depicting the story of the Jade Rabbit. The beautiful lantern sets brought a magical touch to the Gardens at night.”</p>
  <p>The Festival also featured 4,000 lanterns painted by the community at the Colonnade of Lights, nightly cultural performances, the ever-popular Food Street and Ron Arad’s 720°, a multimedia installation.</p>
