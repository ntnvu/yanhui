        subtitle: "Majestic Bay Seafood Restaurant"
        note: "
        <p>Savour award-winning Chef Yong Bing Ngen’s creations, a combination of new innovations and classic favourites. Majestic Bay is the Majestic Group’s first seafood themed restaurant, and freshness is key here, evident from the “live” water tanks flanking the entrance. Crab fans can look forward to Chef Yong’s masterpiece and labour of love, his signature “Kopi” Crab dish. Smothered in a special sauce blended with 3 coffee bean varieties, this dish took Chef Yong over 3 months to perfect. The Kopi Crab dish comes with a performance too: flambéed before your eyes with a mixture of rice wine and coffee liqueur, with a final touch of coffee beans just before serving for an extra burst of caramelised fragrance.</p>
        <p>Members dining at the same table can enjoy a complimentary non-alcoholic welcome drink with any order. You can receive a complimentary box of freshly baked walnut cookies worth S$18 when you spend S$150 in a single dine-in receipt. Dining on your birthday? Enjoy handmade mini longevity peach buns with lotus seed paste filling with any amount spent (dine-in only), on the house!</p>
